## Experimental Beijing theme

An Omeka theme used for the media archive accompanying the book Experimental Beijing by Sasha Welland.

This theme is based on the Foundation theme for Omeka, a very basic Omeka port of the Zurb Foundation framework (now upgraded for Omeka 2). Foundation is based around The Grid; a twelve-column, semi-liquid layout. Find out more at: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/index.php

Foundation 3 and 4 no longer support IE7, if you require IE7 support then check out https://github.com/katel/omeka-foundation-v2.
