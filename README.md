# Experimental Beijing theme

An Omeka theme used for the media archive accompanying the book
Experimental Beijing by Sasha Welland.

## Development notes

Stylesheets are generated using sass and the susy grid system.
We provide a configuration for compiling using compass.
You will need to install these Ruby gems:

```sh
gem install sass compass susy
```

Then run `compass compile` from the css directory.
